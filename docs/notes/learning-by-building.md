# Learning by Building (Operating System)

## Goal
Build real, production-shaped deliverables and learn only what is needed to ship the next increment.

## Daily Loop (60–90 minutes)
1) Build (35–45m): implement one small working increment.
2) Prove (10–15m): add evidence (screenshot/output/log/metric/alert).
3) Document (10–15m): short notes: what/why/risk/cost.
4) Commit + Project update (5–10m): one commit + move Issue (Todo → In Progress → Done).

## Rules
- Every day = one GitHub Issue (English) + one commit.
- Documentation is reference-driven (max 5–10m/day, only to unblock the build).
- Security-by-default and least privilege.
- Prefer low-cost execution: local first (kind), then AWS/EKS when needed.

## Definition of Done (per day)
- A working increment is merged/pushed (code or docs).
- Evidence is captured (link or screenshot reference).
- Notes updated in docs/notes/ with key takeaways + next risks.
- Issue moved to Done in the GitHub Project.
