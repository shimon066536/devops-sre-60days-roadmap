# DevOps/SRE 60 Days Roadmap – Shimon Nagar

This repository is my personal 60-day DevOps / SRE learning and practice roadmap.

It combines:

- A structured daily study plan (60 days, 6 stages).
- Hands-on projects (Terraform, Kubernetes, CI/CD, Observability, HA/DR).
- GitHub Issues + Project board to track progress over time.

---

## Goals
- Strengthen Cloud Security, Observability, IaC, CI/CD and Production-Grade Architectures.
- Build 1-2 flagship projects that are ready for GitHub & LinkedIn.
- Prepare for mid-level DevOps/SRE roles (Israel & remote).

## Tracks (Skill Areas)
1. Cloud Security & IAM
2. Observability & Monitoring
3. Multi-Cloud (Azure/GCP)
4. Advanced IaC & Automation
5. Service Mesh & Cost Optimization
6. CI/CD with Quality & Security Gates
7. Scalability, HA/DR, Multi-Region
8. Open Source & Networking
9. Mentoring & Leadership
10. Interview & Incident Simulations

## Study Plan – 60 Days
- Stage 1 (Days 1-12): AWS & Cloud Security
- Stage 2 (Days 13-22): Observability & Monitoring
- Stage 3 (Days 23-32): IaC & Multi-Cloud
- Stage 4 (Days 33-42): CI/CD & Security Automation
- Stage 5 (Days 43-55): Networking, Cost, HA/DR
- Stage 6 (Days 56-60+): Final Flagship Project
